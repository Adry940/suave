title: simple arbitrage bot
---
simple-arbitrage is a repository that contains a simple, mechanical system for discovering, evaluating, rating, and submitting arbitrage opportunities to the Flashbots bundle endpoint. This script is very unlikely to be profitable, as many users have access to it, and it is targeting well-known Ethereum opportunities.

We hope you will use this repository as an example of how to integrate Flashbots into your own Flashbot searcher (bot). For more information, see the [Flashbots Searcher FAQ](https://github.com/flashbots/pm/blob/main/guides/searcher-onboarding.md)
