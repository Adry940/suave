# Setup SUAVE

## Our goal

A SUAVE node is really two nodes in a trenchcoat, both participating in the same p2p network. We're going to start them both in this guide. 

1. The "MEVM instance" is a full node that can run confidential computation and broadcast the results. You need to run it in order to _act on information_ you receive (i.e. run confidential computation). You need to run one MEVM instance per domain. Right now, we support Ethereum L1, but more domains will become available as we add the necessary precompiles, like `simulatePolygonBundle` or `buildOptimismBlock` etc. This will mean running many MEVM instances: one for each domain.

2. The "Chain instance" is also a full node. You need to run it in order to _receive information_ about transactions on any domain that broadcasts to the SUAVE chain. You only need to run one of these, as everyone should broadcast their hints on SUAVE.

## Docker

### What you need

1. Install Docker. You can find general directions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
    1. If you're running Ubuntu or Debian, we recommend [this specific guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#installation-methods).
2. Make sure you have `docker-compose` installed too. The should just happen when you install Docker.
    1. Check with `docker-compose version` (Docker Engine) or `docker compose version` (Docker Desktop).
3. We do not have high RAM, disk, or bandwidth requirements. This section should work on most consumer laptops.

### What to do

1. Clone suave-geth:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth.git
```
2. Get to the right place in the repo:
```bash
cd suave-geth/suave/devenv/
```
3. Run SUAVE:
```bash
docker-compose up -d 
```

### What just happened

Both SUAVE nodes are now running as a daemon process (because of the `-d` flag in the `docker-compose` command). Well done!

1. Read more about [confidential computation](/reference/confidential-computation/index) and the [APIs we've built to enable it](/reference/confidential-computation/apis).
2. Dig deeper in the [architecture of the MEVM](/reference/MEVM#architecture).
3. Browse a full list of the [precompiles this gives you access to in any smart contract](/reference/precompiles).

### Common problems

<details>
  <summary>1. Docker not running</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      <div>
        Make sure that Docker is running before trying <code>docker-compose up -d</code>. On most Linux machines, you can do this with:<br/>
        <code>
        sudo systemctl start docker
        </code><br/><br/>
        Or just check the current status with:<br/>
        <code>
        sudo systemctl status docker
        </code>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>2. Using Docker Desktop</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      If you're using Docker Desktop, it's likely that you need to use <code>docker compose up -d</code> (without the <code>-</code>).
    </div>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>3. Older OS won't shut down</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      <div>
        Depending on your OS version and the way you installed Docker, you might have issues switching your new SUAVE node off again. If so:<br/>
        <code>
        sudo killall containerd-shim
        </code><br/><br/>
        Now you should be able to run:<br/>
        <code>
        sudo docker-compose down
        </code>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</details>

## Build it yourself

The `docker-compose` version above sets up SUAVE using simple defaults. If you'd like to run the binaries yourself and customise what is happening, read on.

### What you need

1. [Install go](https://go.dev/doc/install).

### What to do

1. Clone the repo and build the adapted geth client first with:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth.git
cd suave-geth
make suave
```
2. Run the MEVM instace first:
```bash
./build/bin/suave --dev --dev.gaslimit 30000000 --datadir suave_dev --http --ws \
--allow-insecure-unlock --unlock "0xb5feafbdd752ad52afb7e1bd2e40432a485bbb7f" \
--keystore ./suave/devenv/suave-ex-node/keystore/
```
3. Press `Enter` when prompted for a password
4. In a new terminal, run the Chain instance:
```bash
./build/bin/suave --dev --dev.gaslimit 30000000 --http --http.port 8555 --ws --ws.port 8556 --authrpc.port 8561
```

### What to do next

You can now run any SUAVE command you like. Start by generating a new account (in another terminal):

```bash
./build/bin/suave --suave account new
```

Consult the help page for anything else you need to do:
```bash
./build/bin/suave --suave help
```
