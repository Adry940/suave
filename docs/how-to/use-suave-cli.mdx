# Use SUAVE CLI

On this page, you will find a recipe for installing the SUAVE command line interface (CLI) and using it to deploy and interact with contracts on a SUAVE network running on your local machine.

This recipe is an _instruction set_ that enables you to use SUAVE CLI. Our goal is to 

1. install the tool
2. run a local SUAVE network
3. deploy some basic contracts to that network
4. interact with those contracts and see what happens

> _SUAVE CLI was developed to test and demonstrate potential ways to use SUAVE. It is **not** necessary to incorporate it into your own toolkit._

Explanation of how contracts we'll be deploying work, and further description of builder solidity, is kept in the technical details part of this site. We recommend that you read the [worked examples section](/reference/builder-solidity/worked-examples/mev-share) after completing this guide.

## Install

You need to have [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) installed to follow this guide.

1. Clone the repo and get to the right place:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth.git
cd suave-geth
```
2. Install SUAVE CLI:
```bash
go mod tidy
go build -o suavecli ./suave/cmd/suavecli
```

## Run a local SUAVE node

This is also explained in the [previous guide](/how-to/setup-suave#build-it-yourself).

1. Make the SUAVE node (from within the same `suave-geth` directory as above):
```bash
make suave
```
2. Run the MEVM instance first:
```bash
./build/bin/suave --dev --dev.gaslimit 30000000 --datadir suave_dev --http --ws \
--allow-insecure-unlock --unlock "0xb5feafbdd752ad52afb7e1bd2e40432a485bbb7f" \
--keystore ./suave/devenv/suave-ex-node/keystore/
```
3. Press `Enter` when prompted for a password
4. In a new terminal, run the Chain instance:
```bash
./build/bin/suave --dev --dev.gaslimit 30000000 --http --http.port 8555 --ws --ws.port 8556 --authrpc.port 8561
```

## Deploy MEVShare

Our SUAVE node (which is two nodes in a trenchcoat) has been deployed with a specific account set as the "dev account". This accounts has some funds we can use to deploy contracts and interact with the chain, we just need to let SUAVE CLI know what its private key is when sending transactions.

1. Deploy MEVShare.sol:
```bash
./suavecli deployMevShareContract --privkey "6c45335a22461ccdb978b78ab61b238bad2fae4544fb55c14eb096c875ccfc52"
```
2. **Take note of the contract address printed at the end of the logs in your console**.

The [MEVShare.sol contract we just deployed is explained in detail in our worked examples](/reference/builder-solidity/worked-examples/mev-share).

## Send a MEVShare bundle

The basic flow of MEV-sharing is:

1. Users send transactions they want to be protected from MEV to this contract.
2. The contract emits hints about those transactions in event logs, which searchers listen for.
3. Searchers send backrun transactions which potentially match the user transactions in (1).
4. The contract merges these transactions and stores them in its `confidentialDataStore`.

So, let's send a bundle of transactions to the contract we just deployed. 

We'll use the contract address you noted in step (2) above. We also need a `goerli_rpc` address, provided below:

```bash
./suavecli sendMevShareBundle --privkey "6c45335a22461ccdb978b78ab61b238bad2fae4544fb55c14eb096c875ccfc52"  \
--ex_node_addr "0xb5feafbdd752ad52afb7e1bd2e40432a485bbb7f" --mev_share_addr "<YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS>"  \
--goerli_rpc "https://eth-goerli.alchemyapi.io/v2/oKxs-03sij-U_N0iOlrSsZFr29-IqbuF"
```
