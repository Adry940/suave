10. This result is often thought to be impossible without a trusted third party. However, when we have not just votes, but transfers as primitives in the system, we can design new mechanisms which exhibit the kind of quantifiable fairness we're interested in.
11. Aside: "fairness" here is an economic concept, not a normative one (just as censorship resistance is an engineering problem based on cost models, rather than an ideological one based on rhetoric).
12. SUAVE enables anyone to encode the nature of such transfers - whether that is new kinds of order flow auctions, more efficient block building algorithms, new kinds of DEXes, pre-confirmations, etc. - in such a way that the value created by the order in which they occur tends to flow back to the people participating.
12. **Claim 3**: SUAVE is therefore an environment for programming money in increasingly democratic ways. This is enormously cool.

Is it worth going over _The Public and its Problems_ here? Combined with the final section of "The Future of MEV is SUAVE"...
