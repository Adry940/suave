This section is where I will introduce conceptual foundations for a general audience.

1. MEV arises from the time it takes to communicate information.
2. Those who receive it first get to order it. 
3. Ordering information is how we derive meaning. 
4. Meaning is intimately tied to value.
5. **Claim 1:** Our systems should enable people to enjoy the value they create by virtue of the way information associated with their actions is ordered collectively.

6. More simply, we should aim to build fair systems (little historical aside about Nakamoto consensus and public mempools)
7. We define fairness as "the highest payout should not be significantly greater than the average".
8. This allows us to think in very concrete, quantifiable ways about welfare (cc Tarun)
9. **Claim 2**: We're trying to anticipate how the medium moves our messages so that no-one is unfairly manipulated.

10. This result is often thought to be impossible without a trusted third party. However, when we have not just votes, but transfers as primitives in the system, we can design new mechanisms which exhibit the kind of quantifiable fairness we're interested in.
11. Aside: "fairness" here is an economic concept, not a normative one (just as censorship resistance is an engineering problem based on cost models, rather than an ideological one based on rhetoric).
12. Suave enables anyone to encode the nature of such transfers - whether that is new kinds of order flow auctions, more efficient block building algorithms, new kinds of DEXes, pre-confirmations, etc. - in such a way that the value created by the order in which they occur tends to flow back to the people participating.
12. **Claim 3**: Suave is therefore an environment for programming money in increasingly democratic ways. This is enormously cool.
