Flashbots is a research and development organization working on mitigating the negative externalities of current MEV extraction techniques and avoiding the existential risks MEV could cause to state-rich blockchains like Ethereum. Our primary focus is to enable a permissionless, transparent, and fair ecosystem for MEV extraction. It falls under three goals: Democratizing Access to MEV Revenue, Bringing Transparency to MEV Activity and Redistributing MEV Revenue.

We've released two projects so far: 
* Flashbots Core: currently in its alpha phase, a proof of concept communication channel between miners and searchers for transparent and efficient MEV extraction.
* MEV-Explore: a public dashboard and live transactions explorer of MEV activity.

You can interact with Flashbots on Discord and Github. We have dedicated channels on Discord for each of our efforts and welcome contributions. Our work is open source and you can follow our progress in each repository of the Flashbots organization. In addition, we hold several recurring community calls: a monthly MEV Roast, a bi-weekly research workshop and a monthly transparency call to update the community on our progress. 

The current repository you're in provides an overview of our activities, and contains our [open job searches](https://github.com/flashbots/pm/tree/main/jobs) and the [onboarding documents](https://github.com/flashbots/pm/tree/main/guides) to start using the Alpha we've released, either as a miner or as a searcher.
