Flashbots is a research and development organization working on mitigating the negative externalities of current MEV extraction techniques and avoiding the existential risks MEV could cause to state-rich blockchains like Ethereum. Our primary focus is to enable a permissionless, transparent, and fair ecosystem for MEV extraction. It falls under three goals: Democratizing Access to MEV Revenue, Bringing Transparency to MEV Activity, and Redistributing MEV Revenue.

Our efforts are focused on three verticals:
- Flashbots Core: a private communication channel between miners and searchers for transparent and efficient MEV extraction.
- Flashbots Data: a suite of tools for increasing MEV transparency and reducing information asymmetry.
- Flashbots Research: an open, transparent, and iterative creation process to answer big questions.

The Flashbots organization is funded by long term capital partners with a track record of alignment with the ecosystem. Our current capital partner is [Paradigm](https://www.paradigm.xyz).

You can interact with Flashbots on Discord and Github. We have dedicated channels on Discord for each of our efforts and welcome contributions. Our work is open source and you can follow our progress in each repository of the Flashbots organization. In addition, we hold several recurring community calls: a monthly MEV Roast, a bi-weekly research workshop and a monthly transparency call to update the community on our progress.

## Our organization
Flashbots research and development are tightly-coupled dual engines that propel the organization in a phased approach:
- **Long-term oriented research efforts** spec out and update our roadmap, define our organizationâ€™s phases and identify key milestones associated with each of them;
- **Milestone-oriented engineering efforts** ship core infrastructure and ecosystem tools, while collecting data and producing other artifacts that feed back into research.

### Interested in contributing? 
We are not your typical project, we are fully remote and our principles are based on that of a [pirate hacker collective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0fAznO1wA8). If you are a self-directed individual who puts collective success above your own and are motivated by solving hard problems with asymmetric impact, you will fit right in. 

* [open job positions](https://github.com/flashbots/pm/tree/main/jobs) - full-time roles we're actively recruiting for.
* [flashbots research fellowship](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-research/blob/main/research_fellowship.md) - we issue research grants to flashbots research proposals submitters. Find out more in our research repo.
* flashbots part-time contractor - become a part-time contractor in Flashbots and join one of our ongoing projects. Reach out to the team to learn more!

### MEV Roast Recordings!

MEV Roast is a monthly discussion that stems from the research collective MEV Pi-rate Ship tradition. It's meant to service as a communication bridge between Flashbots and the broader community interested in understanding MEV and contribute to our research and engineering efforts. The format of our Roast is meant to invite constructive criticism on the Flashbots efforts and to address open questions.
