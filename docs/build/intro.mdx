This section is where we will provide as many practical examples as possible to get ecosystem partners up to speed and feeling comfortable.

## The basic outline

1. **Replace trusted third parties (TTPs) with trusted execution environments (TEEs)**
    - in a flexible way that allows for us to shift to MPC, FHE etc as they become viable
2. **Make the operation of the network decentralized** 
    - by letting anyone run TEEs, when viable
3. **Enable user programmability** 
    - all MEV applications exist as smart contracts, written in builder solidity

The goal of these three steps is to create an **open marketplace for mechanisms** which illuminate, democratize, and distribute the value we create collectively, rather than allowing it to be routed into dark and unreachable places controlled by the powerful.

The set of possible mechanisms in such a marketplace makes Suave highly general, as they can include: 

- new kinds of order flow auctions
- more efficient block building algorithms
- shared sequencers for different rollups 
    - and more secure, efficient bridges
- various types of commitments
- new kinds of DEXes
- pre-confirmations
- any combination of the above
- many more ideas we haven't thought of yet.

## What's in the sausage

1. Builder solidity (we begin here because I think the primary aim is to get people experimenting with contracts, both because we have more examples and because it highlights further needs for precompiles)

    2. Examples of how to use it 
        - Custom peekers mev-share (specifically to engage with design of OFA on Suave)
        - Suave Peekers Proof of Concept (specifically to engage with block building)
2. What is a Suave peeker? (while some stuff in here contextualises the example above, it's dense and should come after we discuss getting your first contract written)
