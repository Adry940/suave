# Setup SUAVE

## Local - Docker

### What you need

1. Install Docker. You can find general directions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
    1. If you're running Ubuntu or Debian, we recommend [this specific guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#installation-methods).
2. Make sure you have `docker-compose` installed too. The should just happen when you install Docker.
    1. Check with `docker-compose version` (Docker Engine) or `docker compose version` (Docker Desktop).
3. We do not have high RAM, disk, or bandwidth requirements. This section should work on most consumer laptops.

### What to do

1. Clone suave-geth:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth.git
```
2. Get to the right place in the repo:
```bash
cd suave-geth/suave/devenv/
```
3. Run SUAVE:
```bash
docker-compose up -d 
```

### What just happened

You just setup SUAVE and it's now running as a daemon process (which happened because of the `-d` flag we used in the `docker-compose` command). Well done!

There are two kinds of SUAVE nodes, both participating in the same p2p network. We load them both in this setup. The "SUAVE Chain node" is a full node and the "MEVM node" is a full node with the ability to run confidential computation and broadcast the results.

1. You can find more information about [confidential computation](/reference/confidential-computation) and the [APIs we've built to enable it](/reference/confidential-computation#apis).
2. Dig deeper in the [architecture of the MEVM](/reference/MEVM#architecture).
3. See a full list of the [precompiles this gives you access to in any smart contract](/reference/precompiles).

### Common problems

<details>
  <summary>1. Docker not running</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      <div>
        Make sure that Docker is running before trying <code>docker-compose up -d</code>. On most Linux machines, you can do this with:<br/>
        <code>
        sudo systemctl start docker
        </code><br/><br/>
        Or just check the current status with:<br/>
        <code>
        sudo systemctl status docker
        </code>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>2. Using Docker Desktop</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      If you're using Docker Desktop, it's likely that you need to use <code>docker compose up -d</code> (without the <code>-</code>).

<details>
  <summary>3. Older OS won't shut down</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      <div>
        Depending on your OS version and the way you installed Docker, you might have issues switching your new MEVM node off again. If so:<br/>
        <code>
        sudo killall containerd-shim
        </code><br/><br/>
        Now you should be able to run:<br/>
        <code>
        sudo docker-compose down
        </code>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</details>

## Local - build it yourself

The `docker-compose` version above sets up SUAVE using simple defaults. If you'd like to run the binaries yourself and customise what is happening, read on.

### What you need

1. [Install go](https://go.dev/doc/install).

### What to do

1. Clone the repo and build the adapted geth client first with:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth.git
cd suave-geth
make geth
```
2. Run the MEVM node first:
```bash
./build/bin/geth --dev --dev.gaslimit 30000000 --datadir suave_dev --http --ws \
--allow-insecure-unlock --unlock "0xb5feafbdd752ad52afb7e1bd2e40432a485bbb7f" \
--keystore ./suave/devenv/suave-ex-node/keystore/
```
3. Press `Enter` when prompted for a password
4. In a new terminal, run the SUAVE Chain node:
```bash
./build/bin/geth --dev --dev.gaslimit 30000000 --http --http.port 8555 --ws
```

### What to do next

You can now run any `geth` command you like, with an additional `--suave` flag. Start by generating a new account:

```bash
./build/bin/geth --suave account new
```

Consult the help page for anything else you need to do:
```bash
./build/bin/geth --suave help
```

## Cloud - Docker

### What you need

1. Use the cheapest instance you can. We don't have high RAM, disk, or bandwidth requirements at this stage.
2. Use **Ubuntu 22.04**.
3. This guide is tested on a 1GB CPU, 25GB SSD machine in Digital Ocean, and on a `t2.micro` EC2 instance (free-tier) in AWS. 
    1. Digital Ocean requires the least Docker setup in our experience. 
    2. You **do not** need Docker itself installed to follow this section.

### What to do

1. Install `docker-compose`:
```bash
apt install docker-compose
```

    <div>
      Ubuntu images in certain cloud providers do not come with Docker's Apt repository already set up. Therefore, you may need to add it manually:<br/><br/>
      <code>
      sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings<br/>
      curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg<br/>
      sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg<br/><br/>
      echo \
      "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
      "$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | \
      sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
      <br/><br/>
      sudo apt-get update
      <br/><br/>
      sudo apt install docker-compose
      </code>
    </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</details>

2. Clone the software and get to the right place:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth.git
cd suave-geth/suave/devenv/
```
3. Run SUAVE (you may need to run this as `sudo`):
```bash
docker-compose up -d 
```
