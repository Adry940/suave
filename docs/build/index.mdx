SUAVE uses the **MEVM**, which is a modified EVM with new precompiles for MEV use cases. Using the MEVM, you can program MEV applications as smart contracts within an expressive, familiar, and flexible programming environment - just like the normal EVM. 

The MEVM offers every primitive of the MEV supply chain as a precompile, allowing any centralized MEV infrastructure to be transformed into a smart contract running on SUAVE.

SUAVE is focused on delivering the properties you need: low latency, privacy, credible computation, and composability.

## What can I do with SUAVE?

1. **Deploy more expressive smart contracts.** 
    - Smart contracts on SUAVE follow the same rules as on Ethereum, with the added advantage of being able to access additional precompiles we have made available to serve any MEV application. You can find a list of these precompiles in the [reference section](/reference/precompiles).

2. **Enjoy confidential execution**. 
    - Using the precompiles above, smart contracts can define computation that can occur "off-chain", that is, in a manner in which the data involved is not exposed to everyone using SUAVE, but is encrypted to specific actors. Once the node(s) I have encrypted my data for complete the confidential computation, the result replaces the calldata for on-chain execution. This creates a public and transparent marketplace of applications in which we can inspect, collaborate, and compete to produce the most efficient order flow auctions, or block building algorithsm etc., while nevertheless protecting the data of the people who use those applications.

> **We want to enable you to build new applications that you cannot build on Ethereum in a decentralized way today.**  

Initially, we will support applications that require:

1. **private data**, e.g., auctions, block building
2. **coordination within block times**, e.g., block building, trade routing and filling
3. **access to fresh off-chain data**, e.g., trading strategies conditional on centralized exchange prices or transactions that are conditional on other transactions
4. **commitments** of various kinds, e.g., shared sequencers for rollups, new kinds of DEXes and bridges
5. **too much gas to do on-chain** because of how much compute they use, e.g., block building.
