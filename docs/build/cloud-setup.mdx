# Setup Suave remotely

### What you need

1. Use the cheapest instance you can. We don't have high RAM, disk, or bandwidth requirements at this stage.
2. Use **Ubuntu 22.04**.
3. This guide is tested on a 1GB CPU, 25GB SSD machine in Digital Ocean, and on a `t2.micro` EC2 instance (free-tier) in AWS. 
    1. We default to Digital Ocean due to the ease with which `docker-compose` works there. 
    2. You **do not** need Docker itself installed to follow this guide.

### What to do

1. Install `docker-compose`:
<Tabs
  defaultValue="do"
  values={[
    {label: 'Digital Ocean', value: 'do'},
    {label: 'AWS', value: 'aws'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="do">
    <pre>
        apt install docker-compose
    </pre>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="aws">
    Ubuntu images in AWS do not come with Docker's Apt repository already set up. Therefore, you need to add it manually before installing: <code>docker-compose</code>:

    sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
    sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

    # Add the repository to Apt sources:
    echo \
    "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
    "$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | \
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

    # Update
    sudo apt-get update

    # Install docker-compose
    sudo apt install docker-compose
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

2. Clone the software and get to the right place:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth.git
cd suave-geth/suave/devenv/
```
3. Run SUAVE (you'll need to run this as `sudo` in AWS):
```bash
docker-compose up -d 
```
