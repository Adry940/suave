# Welcome to Suave

Suave is a decentralized network where anyone can create smart contracts that define orderflow auctions and build blocks. 

Only an open marketplace for fair ”MEV applications” can keep ahead of extractive collusion and centralization.

Suave empowers us to **commit to fairness** and **configure privacy**, securing and building upon Ethereum (and networks like it).

## Where to go

This site has been crafted in two, interdependent sections. The **Learn** section describes the conceptual foundations for all things Suave. The **Build** section details how to create innovative applications and mechanisms using Suave. 

We learn by building, and we build better when we're learning. The two sections complement one another, so while we know your needs and interests will lead you in one direction at first, we encourage you to reflect on both sections when you find the time.

## About Flashbots

Our primary focus is to enable a permissionless, transparent, and fair ecosystem for MEV extraction. We achieve this in three ways: **Illuminating** MEV activity, **Democratizing** access to MEV tooling, and **Distributing** MEV revenue.

We focus on:

- **Product**: engineering products to fulfill our mission. This includes the Flashbots Auction with the Flashbots Relay, the Flashbots Protect RPC, MEV-Inspect, MEV-Explore, MEV-Boost, and MEV-Share.
- **Coordination**: organizing processes, interfacing with external teams in the ecosystem, and scaling ourselves to maximize our impact.
- **Research**: open, transparent, and collaborative research to tackle short and long term research questions relevant to MEV.

You can interact with Flashbots on [Discord](https://discord.gg/7hvTycdNcK), [Github](https://github.com/flashbots/), and our [Discourse forum](https://collective.flashbots.net/). We have dedicated channels on Discord for each of our efforts and welcome your contributions. Our work is open source and you can follow our progress in each Github repository.
